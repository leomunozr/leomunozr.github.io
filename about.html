## About me

My name is Leo Mu√±oz. I'm a software developer living in wonderful Mexico City. When I'm not coding I like to stroll down the city with my camera and take a ton of pictures. I'm a fan of traveling, visiting new places and learning languages.

I create web apps with a focus on a smooth user experience. I try to follow the latest best-practice standards to have my code neat and tidy. I'm constantly learning new technologies to stay relevant and bring the best of engineering and innovation together. I believe code is a strong tool to improve life quality.

You can get in touch with me by writing to my [e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}). I'd be happy to respond.
