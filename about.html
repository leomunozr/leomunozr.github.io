## Hello, there!

My name is Leo Mu√±oz. I'm a software developer living in wonderful Mexico City. When I'm not coding I like to stroll down the city with my camera and take a ton of pictures. I'm a fan of traveling, visiting new places and learning languages.

I create web apps with a focus on a smooth user experience. I try to follow the latest best-practice standards to have my code neat and tidy. I'm constantly learning new technologies so I can provide projects with added value. I believe code is a strong tool to improve life quality.
